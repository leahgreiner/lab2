```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(choco, aes(x = Review.Date)) + geom_bar(aes(weight= Review.Date)) 
```
Question set 2:
For each of the questions below provide at least one graphic as a basis for your answer.
1. How are ratings distributed? Draw a histogram of ratings and describe it. Donâ€™t forget to mention outliers, if there are any.
